# natlinkutils.py
#   This file contains utility classes and functions for grammar files.
#
# September 2013 (QH):
# use import natlink instead of from natlink import *, forcing qualifying all calls to natlink functions from this module.
# March 2010 (QH):
#   - added deactivateSet() function in GrammarBase
#   - added exceptlist optional variable to activateAll method of GrammarBase
#   - added callRuleResultsFunctions in resultsCallback, so the calling of
#         the rule result functions can be overloaded (for DocstringGrammar)
# Dec 2009:
#   - added the variable self.doOnlyGotResultsObject, which can be set inside a user gotResultsObject
#     routine, in order to NOT further process the recognition
#     (for kaiser_dictation.py, dictation to target application, QH)
# August 17, 2009
#   - added throughWords in SelectGramBase, in order to make more
#     throughWords possible, like "through" and "until".
# April 1, 2000
#   - reformated this file to move documentation to the beginning of
#     the classes
#   - added DictGramBase and SelectGramBase and split common functions
#     into shared internal GramClassBase
#
# Documentation
#
# This file contains three base classes and some useful constants and
# utility functions.
#
#   GrammarBase - base class for all command and control grammars.
#       See documentation below just before the class definition.
#
#   DictGramBase - base class for all pure dictation grammars.
#       See documentation below just before the class definition.
#
#   SelectGramBase - base class for all selection grammars.
#       See documentation below just before the class definition.
#
#   buttonClick( btnName='left',count=1 )
#       This function simulates a button click or button double click.  Pass
#       in the button name ('left','right' or 'middle') and the count (1 or
#       2)
#
#   matchWindow( moduleInfo, modName, wndText )
#       A utility function which determines whether moduleInfo matches a
#       specified module name and window title.  Returns window handle on
#       match and None on mismatch. Note that moduleInfo may be ("","",0)
#       which we should handle cleanly.
#
#   See also the constants at the top of this file.

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GrammarBase
#
# This is the basic grammar class.  All user grammar classes should use this
# as the base class.
#
# Here are the functions which derived classes can call:
#
#   load( gramSpec, allResults=0, hypothesis=0 )
#       This function will takes a textual representation of a grammar,
#       either as a single string or as a list of strings and load that
#       grammar into Dragon NaturallySpeaking.
#
#       allResults=1 will make it so this grammar see every recognition
#           result even if it is for another grammar,
#       hypothesis=1 means that the gotHypothesis callback will be made.
#           Otherwise, that callback is not made to avoid too much overhead.
#
#   unload()
#       Unload reset the state of the grammar.  Any SAPI objects will be
#       freed and all callbacks will be terminated.
#
# You need to activate rules before they will be recognized.  You activate
# rules by name.  Any rule which is "exported" in the grammar can be
# activated.  This base class offers a number of was to activate rules
# depending on what is convient.
#
#   activate( ruleName, window=0, exclusive=None, noError=0 )
#       Activate a single rule by name.
#
#       noError=1 will suppress the error message when you try to activate
#           a rule which is already active
#       window=N will activate this rule conditionally when the window
#           whose window handle is X is the foreground window.  This is
#           the normal case.  Use window=0 to activate a global rule.
#       exclusive=1 will make this grammar exclusive which means that no
#           other grammars will be included in recognition when this
#           grammar is active unless they are also exclusive
#
#   activateSet( ruleNames, window=0, exclusive=None )
#       This is the most efficient way to activate rules, it takes a list of
#       rules and makes sure that all those rules and only those rules are
#       active.  Do not use this function to change the window handle if you
#       have already activates some rules with a different window handle.
#
#   activateAll( window=0, exclusive=None, exceptlist=None )
#       This will activate every exported rule.
#       can optionally add a list of rules NOT to activate (QH, 2010)
#
#   deactivate( ruleName, noError=0 )
#       Deactivates a single rule by name.
#         noError=1 will suppress the error message when you try to deactivate
#             a rule which is not active
#
#   deactivateAll():
#       This will deactivate every currently active rule.
#
#   setExclusive( exclusive ):
#       Set or reset the exclusive flag for this grammar (see comments under
#       activate method).
#
# Lists are part of SAPI.  They are list subrules except that they can be
# changed while the grammar is loaded.  Also, the list a word comes from is
# not available in recognition results, you only see the innermost rule name
# in recognition results.
#
#   emptyList( listName )
#       This will remove all words currently in a names list.
#
#   appendList( listName, words )
#       This will add one word (phrase) or a list of words (phrases) to a
#       named list.
#
#   setList( listName, words )
#       This function is an efficient way to set the contents of a list in    
#       one operation to a list of words or phrases.
#
# Derived classes should defined callback functions if they want recognition
# results.  The following callback functions can be defined:
#
#   gotBegin( moduleInfo )
#       called when speech is detected before recognition begins.  The
#       parameter is the same value returned by getCurrentModule.
#
#   gotResultsObject( recogType, resObj )
#       called when results are available (before any of the other results
#       callbacks).  The first parameter is one of 'self','other' or 'reject'
#       where the second two types are only possible if the allResults flag
#       was set on the load call.  The second parameter is the results object.
#
#   gotResultsInit( words, fullResults )
#       called when results are available for this grammar before any calls
#       to gotResults_XXX.  Parameters are a list of the recognized words
#       and a list of word,ruleName pairs.
#
#   gotResults_XXX( words, fullResults )
#       called when results are available.  The XXX refers to the rule name
#       in the grammar.  This function is called once for each sequential
#       series of words in the results which come from the same rule in the
#       grammar.  The first parameter is the sequential series of words and
#       the second parameter is a list of word,ruleName pairs.
#
#   gotResults( words, fullResults )
#       called when results are available for this grammar before any calls
#       to gotResults_XXX.  Parameters are a list of the recognized words
#       and the same value a list of word,ruleName pairs.
#
#   gotHypothesis( words)
#       only called when the hypothesis flag is set on load, this callback
#       contains the partial recognition hypothesis during recognition.
#       
# Here is an example of how the callbacks work.  Assume the following grammar:
#
#   <start> exported = this <ruleOne> is {list}
#   <ruleOne> = big <ruleTwo> object
#   <ruleTwo> = red | blue
#   
# And assume that {list} contains the words "good" and "bad".
#
# Now if "this big red object is good" is recognized, the following callbacks
# will be made (in the order indicated).  
#
# (Note: The second parameter to gotResults_XXX and gotResults is the same as
# the second parameter to gotResultsInit.  The example has been abbreviated
# to save space.)
#
#   gotBegin( ??? )
#   gotResultsObject( 'self', resObj )
#   gotResultsInit( 
#       ['this','big','red','object','is','good'],
#       [('this','start'),('big','ruleOne'),('red','RuleTwo'),
#           ('object','ruleOne'),('is','start'),('good','start')] )
#   gotResults_start( ['this'], ... )
#   gotResults_ruleOne( ['big'], ... )
#   gotResults_ruleTwo( ['red'], ... )
#   gotResults_ruleOne( ['object'], ... )
#   gotResults_start( ['is','good'], ... )
#   gotResults( ['this','big','red','object','is','good'], ... )

# DictGramBase
#        
# This base class is similar to GrammarBase except that it is used for real
# dictation grammars.  A real dictation grammar allows a client application
# to get raw dictation results from the recognizer.  It is very similat to
# creating a command and control grammar with the <dgndictation> rule except
# that you have the added ability to set the dictation context (words to
# consider as having been spoken juct before the current recognition).
#
# Here are the functions which derived classes can call:
#
#   load( allResults=0, hypothesis=0 )
#       Creates the dictation grammar.  See GrammarBase class for definition
#       of flags.
#
#   unload()
#       Unload reset the state of the grammar.  Any SAPI objects will be
#       freed and all callbacks will be terminated.
#
# You need to activate the grammar before it can be recognized.  Activation
# of a dictation grammar is simplier than a command grammar because there
# are no named rules.
#
#   activate( window=0, exclusive=None )
#       noError=1 will suppress the error message when you try to activate
#           a rule which is already active
#       window=N will activate this rule conditionally when the window
#           whose window handle is X is the foreground window.  This is
#           the normal case.  Use window=0 to activate a global rule.
#
#   deactivate()
#       Deactivates the grammar.
#
#   setExclusive( exclusive ):
#       Set or reset the exclusive flag for this grammar (see comments under
#       activate method of GrammarBase).
#
# Dictation gramars have a special method which allows you to indicate what
# text should be considered to been recognized just before this dictation
# result, and after this dictation result.
#
#   setContext( beforeText='', afterText='' )
#       Note current version of Dragon NaturallySpeaking ignore the
#       afterText but the before text is critical to increasing recognition
#       accuracy.
#
# Derived classes should defined callback functions if they want recognition
# results.  The following callback functions can be defined:
#
#   gotBegin( moduleInfo )
#       called when speech is detected before recognition begins.  The
#       parameter is the same value returned by getCurrentModule.
#
#   gotResultsObject( recogType, resObj )
#       called when results are available (before any of the other results
#       callbacks).  The first parameter is one of 'self','other' or 'reject'
#       where the second two types are only possible if the allResults flag
#       was set on the load call.  The second parameter is the results object.
#
#   gotResults( words )
#       called when results are available for this grammar.
#
#       words = list of recognized words
#
#   gotHypothesis( words )
#       only called when the hypothesis flag is set on load, this callback
#       contains the partial recognition hypothesis during recognition.

# SelectGramBase
#
# This base class is similar to GrammarBase except that it is used for
# select XYZ grammars.  A select XYZ grammar is a special grammar which
# recognizes an utterance of the form "<verb> <text> [ through <text> ]"
# where <verb> is specified and <text> is an arbitrary sequence of words in
# a specified text buffer.
#
# Here are the functions which derived classes can call:
#
# make default select and through words "select" and "though" (lower case)
# Quintijn december 2010
# adapt to throughWords as well, for future enhancement VoiceCode
# Quintijn August, 2009
#   load( selectWords=['Select'], throughWord='Through', throughWords=None, allResults=0, hypothesis=0 )
#       selectWords is a list of words or phrases which can introduce a
#           comand of this type.  For example, you can pass in a list like
#           ['Select','Correct','Insert Before','Insert After'] to simulate
#           some of NatSpeak's behavior.
#       throughWord is a single word which is used between the two parts of
#           the command as in "Select <text> Through <text>".  Pass in None
#           or an empty string to disable two part commands.
#       allResults=1 will make it so this grammar see every recognition
#           result even if it is for another grammar,
#       hypothesis=1 means that the gotHypothesis callback will be made.
#           Otherwise, that callback is not made to avoid too much overhead.
#
#   unload()
#       Unload reset the state of the grammar.  Any SAPI objects will be
#       freed and all callbacks will be terminated.
#
# You need to activate the grammar before it can be recognized.  Activation
# of a dictation grammar is simplier than a command grammar because there
# are no named rules.
#
#   activate( window=0, exclusive=None )
#       noError=1 will suppress the error message when you try to activate
#           a rule which is already active
#       window=N will activate this rule conditionally when the window
#           whose window handle is X is the foreground window.  This is
#           the normal case.  Use window=0 to activate a global rule.
#
#   deactivate()
#       Deactivates the grammar.
#
#   setExclusive( exclusive ):
#       Set or reset the exclusive flag for this grammar (see comments under
#       activate method of GrammarBase).
#
# Selection gramars work on a text buffer which you pass to the grammar.
# The speech recognition engine maintains a copy of this text and performs
# all selection on its copy.  Then when the grammar is recognized, you can
# find out the range of text which is effected.
#
#   setSelectText(text)
#       Pass in a block of text (string).
#
#   getSelectText()
#       Returns the text buffer contents currently stored in the speech
